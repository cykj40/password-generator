# password-generator
password generator using html + CSS powered by Java Script

#Description:
I created a password generator. When you click the generate password button. 
The window will prompt you to enter the amount of characters you would like your password to be. 
Your choices are between 8-128 characters long. 
Once you enter a number my funtion will run and return a completely random password that will include upper and lower case letters numbers and special characters.
